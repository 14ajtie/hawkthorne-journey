# Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne

This 2d platformer is based on Community's [Digital Estate Planning][estate]
episode. It's built using the [love](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

## Running
 
- [OS X][osx]
- **TODO** Windows support. I need someone with a windows machine to offer
  Windows builds. Please message me!!

If you already have love installed, you can download the
[hawkthorne.love][love] file and run the game from there.
