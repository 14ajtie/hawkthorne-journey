We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo. Please also create a separate branch

    $ git checkout -b my-cool-feature

   We don't accept pull requests from master branches.

2. Make sure the game runs. Follow the README to see how.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within a few days. We may suggest some changes or
improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted,
taken straight from the Ruby on Rails guide:

* Use Lua idioms and helpers
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution

Syntax:

* Two spaces (or four), no tabs.
* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
